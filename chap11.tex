In November, 1995, Peter Salus, a member of the Free Software Foundation and author of the 1994 book, \textit{A Quarter Century of Unix}, issued a call for papers to members of the GNU Project's ``system-discuss'' mailing list. Salus, the conference's scheduled chairman, wanted to tip off fellow hackers about the upcoming Conference on Freely Redistributable Software in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Slated for February, 1996, and sponsored by the Free Software Foundation, the event promised to be the first engineering conference solely dedicated to free software and, in a show of unity with other free software programmers, welcomed papers on ``any aspect of GNU, Linux, NetBSD, 386BSD, FreeBSD, Perl, Tcl/tk, and other tools for which the code is accessible and redistributable.'' Salus wrote:

1995年11月，自由软件基金会成员彼得·萨卢斯（他于1994年出版了《\textit{Unix的四分之一世纪}》一书），在GNU工程的system-discuss邮件列表中发布了一个通知，为即将在马萨诸塞州召开的“在剑桥自由发布软件”大会征集黑客的论文。这场由自由软件基金会赞助的大会将于1996年2月召开，这是第一个纯由自由软件开发工程师的参加的大会，为了表现出自由软件程序员的团结一致，大会欢迎各种有关GNU、Linux、NetBS、386BSD、FreeBSD、Perl、Tcl/tk和任何可以自由获取和分发的工具软件相关的文章来大会交流。萨卢斯在通知中写道：

Over the past 15 years, free and low-cost software has become ubiquitous. This conference will bring together implementers of several different types of freely redistributable software and publishers of such software (on various media). There will be tutorials and refereed papers, as well as keynotes by Linus Torvalds and Richard Stallman.\endnote{See Peter Salus, ``FYI-Conference on Freely Redistributable Software, 2/2, Cambridge'' (1995) (archived by Terry Winograd), \url{http://bat8.inria.fr/~lang/hotlist/free/licence/fsf96/call-for-papers.html}.}

在过去的15年中，自由和低成本的软件变得越来越重要。本次大会将召集各种可以自由分发的软件的开发者和通过各种渠道发布这类软件的发布者。大会上会有各种教程和参考论文，也会有林纳斯·托瓦兹和理查德·斯托曼的主题演讲。\endnote{参考彼得·萨卢斯, "FYI-Conference on Freely Redistributable Software, 2/2, Cambridge" (1995) （由特里·威诺格拉德提供）。}

\ifdefined\eng
Among the recipients of Salus' email was conference committee member Eric S. Raymond. Although not the leader of a project or company like the various other members of the list, Raymond had built a tidy reputation within the hacker community for some software projects and as editor of \textit{The New Hacker's Dictionary}, a greatly enlarged version of \textit{The Hacker's Dictionary} published a decade earlier by Guy Steele.
\fi

\ifdefined\chs
大会组委会成员埃里克·斯蒂芬·雷蒙德是最早收到萨卢斯的电子邮件的人之一，虽然他不像邮件列表中其它人那样是某个项目的开发负责人或是代表某个公司，但他在GNU Emacs的中的贡献以及作为《\textit{新黑客词典}》（一本收录黑客社会各种黑话的书）的编辑的身份，使他在黑客社区中享有一定的声誉。
\fi

\ifdefined\eng
For Raymond, the 1996 conference was a welcome event. Although he did not thoroughly support the free software movement's ideas, he had contributed to some GNU programs, in particular to GNU Emacs. Those contributions stopped in 1992, when Raymond demanded authority to make changes in the official GNU version of GNU Emacs without discussing them with Stallman, who was directly in charge of Emacs development.  Stallman rejected the demand, and Raymond accused Stallman of ``micro-management.''  ``Richard kicked up a fuss about my making unauthorized modifications when I was cleaning up the Emacs LISP libraries,'' Raymond recalls. ``It frustrated me so much that I decided I didn't want to work with him anymore.''
\fi

\ifdefined\chs
对于雷蒙德来说，1996年的这次大会是一个重要的契机。他在二十世纪80年代在GNU工程中非常活跃，但到了1992以后他就已经不再直接参与这个工程。与许多与他有一样情况的人那样，他对斯托曼的“微管理”风格颇有微词。“理查德对于我在清理Emacs LISP库中的代码时进行的修改非常不满。”雷蒙德回忆到，“这使得我感觉到很沮丧，我再也不想与他一起合作了。”
\fi

\ifdefined\eng
Despite the falling out, Raymond remained active in the free software community. So much so that when Salus suggested a conference pairing Stallman and Torvalds as keynote speakers, Raymond eagerly seconded the idea. With Stallman representing the older, wiser contingent of ITS/Unix hackers and Torvalds representing the younger, more energetic crop of Linux hackers, the pairing indicated a symbolic show of unity that could only be beneficial, especially to ambitious younger (i.e., below 40) hackers such as Raymond. ``I sort of had a foot in both camps,'' Raymond says.
\fi

\ifdefined\chs
除了不再直接参与GNU工程，雷蒙德在自由软件社区中仍然非常活跃。 当萨卢斯建议在大会上由斯托曼和托瓦兹做主题演讲时，雷蒙德非常强烈的建议选用别的方案。斯托曼是老一辈ITS/Unix黑客的传承人而托瓦兹是新一代的更有活力的Linux黑客的代表，这样的搭配是一种联盟的象征，但只会对一部分像雷蒙德这样的年经有抱负的黑客有好处。"我像是那个脚踏两只船的人。” 雷蒙德说。
\fi

\ifdefined\eng
By the time of the conference, the tension between those two camps had become palpable. Both groups had one thing in common, though: the conference was their first chance to meet the Finnish \textit{wunderkind} in the flesh. Surprisingly, Torvalds proved himself to be a charming, affable speaker. Possessing only a slight Swedish accent, Torvalds surprised audience members with his quick, self-effacing wit.\endnote{Although Linus Torvalds is Finnish, his mother tongue is Swedish. ``The Rampantly Unofficial Linus FAQ'' at \url{http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/linus/} offers a brief explanation:

\begin{quote}

Finland has a significant (about 6\%) Swedish-speaking minority population. They call themselves \textit{finlandssvensk} or \textit{finlandssvenskar} and consider themselves Finns; many of their families have lived in Finland for centuries. Swedish is one of Finland's two official languages.

\end{quote}

\ifdefined\chs
会议召开的日子一天天临近，两个团体之间的紧张关系也变得更加明显。两个团体在一个问题上的观点是一致的：这次会议是他们第一次有机会当面见到芬兰神童托瓦兹。托瓦兹出人意料的证明了自己是一个出色和平易进人的演讲者。除了一点点轻徽的瑞典口音，托瓦兹敏捷的思路和谦虚的才智让到场的听众感到惊讶。\endnote{尽管Linus  托瓦兹是芬兰人，但他的母语是瑞典语。“The Rampantly Unofficial Linus FAQ”（\url{http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/linus/}）对此作出以下解释：

\begin{quote}
芬兰有很多（大约6\%）说瑞典语的少数人口。他们把自己叫作“\textit{finlandssvensk}”或“\textit{finladsvenskar}”，并且把他们自己认定是芬兰人。他们很多的家庭都在芬兰居住了很多年。瑞典语是芬兰两种官方语言中的一种。
\end{quote}

} 
\fi

\ifdefined\eng
Even more surprising, says Raymond, was Torvalds' equal willingness to take potshots at other prominent hackers, including the most prominent hacker of all, Richard Stallman. By the end of the conference, Torvalds' half-hacker, half-slacker manner was winning over older and younger conference-goers alike.
\fi

\ifdefined\chs
更让人吃惊的是，雷蒙德说，托瓦兹对其它杰出黑客们的无情抨击，包括所有黑客中最杰出的那位理查德·斯托曼。在大会的最后，托瓦兹的半黑客半懒鬼的作风赢得了新老两代与会人员的青睐。
\fi

\ifdefined\eng
``It was a pivotal moment,'' recalls Raymond. ``Before 1996, Richard was the only credible claimant to being the ideological leader of the entire culture. People who dissented didn't do so in public. The person who broke that taboo was Torvalds.''
\fi

\ifdefined\chs
“这是一个关键的转折点，”雷蒙德回忆道，”在1996年之前，理查德是整个自由软件文化的唯一一个权威的精神领袖。持有不同意见的人都并不在公众面前直接表达。托瓦兹是第一个打破这个禁忌的人。“
\fi

\ifdefined\eng
The ultimate breach of taboo would come near the end of the show. During a discussion on the growing market dominance of Microsoft Windows or some similar topic, Torvalds admitted to being a fan of Microsoft's PowerPoint slideshow software program. From the perspective of old-line software purists, it was like bragging about one's slaves at an abolitionist conference. From the perspective of Torvalds and his growing band of followers, it was simply common sense. Why shun convenient proprietary software programs just to make a point? They didn't agree with the point anyway. When freedom requires a sacrifice, those who don't care about freedom see the sacrifice as self-denial, rather than as a way to obtain something important.  Being a hacker wasn't about self-denial, it was about getting the job done, and ``the job,'' for them, was defined in practical terms.
\fi

\ifdefined\chs
打破禁忌的最后一击出现在大会的最后。在一个有关微软Windows在市场中占有垄断地位的讨论中，托瓦兹承认他自己是微软的PowerPoint这个幻灯片制做软件的发烧友。从老一辈自由软件纯化论者的眼光中，这就像是一个摩门教徒在教堂中自夸自己对威士忌酒的热爱。 从托瓦兹和他越来越多的追随者的言论中，这样的观点并不奇怪。为什么为了表明自己观点就得刻意去回避私有软件呢？做为黑客，不是为了去忍受，而是为了把工作完成。
\fi

\ifdefined\eng
``That was a pretty shocking thing to say,'' Raymond remembers. ``Then again, he was able to do that, because by 1995 and 1996, he was rapidly acquiring clout.''
\fi

\ifdefined\chs
“这是一个振聋发聩的观点，”雷蒙德回忆说，“然而，他可以做到这一点，因为1995年和1996年，他正不断的接受打击。”
\fi

\ifdefined\eng
Stallman, for his part, doesn't remember any tension at the 1996 conference; he probably wasn't present when Torvalds made that statement.  But he does remember later feeling the sting of Torvalds' celebrated ``cheekiness.'' ``There was a thing in the Linux documentation which says print out the GNU coding standards and then tear them up,'' says Stallman, recalling one example. ``When you look closely, what he disagreed with was the least important part of it, the recommendation for how to indent C code.''
\fi

\ifdefined\chs
但斯托曼表示他完全不记得1996年的大会上有什么紧张的气氛，只不过，他记得是那次被托瓦兹的厚脸皮刺激到了而已。“在Linux的文档中，有一段描述，让人们把GNU编码标准打印出来，然后再把它们撕烂。”斯托曼举例道。...................
\fi

\ifdefined\eng
``OK, so he disagrees with some of our conventions. That's fine, but he picked a singularly nasty way of saying so. He could have just said, `Here's the way I think you should indent your code.' Fine. There should be no hostility there.''
\fi

\ifdefined\chs
“好吧，所以他对我们的一些做法持有反对意见。有不同意见是可以的，但是他选择了一种格外令人生厌的方式去表达这样的观点。他完全可以换个说法：“我觉得你可以使用另一种方式来缩进你的代码。这样就不会有攻击性了。”
\fi

\ifdefined\eng
For Raymond, the warm reception other hackers gave to Torvalds' comments confirmed a suspicion: the dividing line separating Linux developers from GNU developers was largely generational. Many Linux hackers, like Torvalds, had grown up in a world of proprietary software. They had begun contributing to free software without perceiving any injustice in nonfree software.  For most of them, nothing was at stake beyond convenience.  Unless a program was technically inferior, they saw little reason to reject it on licensing issues alone. Some day hackers might develop a free software alternative to PowerPoint. Until then, why criticize PowerPoint or Microsoft; why not use it?
\fi

\ifdefined\chs
对于雷蒙德来说，其它黑客给于托瓦兹的热烈评价和真诚的欢迎从另一个角度上证实了他的怀疑。Linux开发者与GNU/Linux开发者之间几乎存在着一个代沟。很多像托瓦兹那样的Linux黑客是在私有软件的世界中成长起来的。除非软件的质量确实很低下，否则没什么人会对软件的许可证问题发出抱怨。在自由软件的世界中，也许隐藏着一个PowerPoint的自由软件替代品。但是，在黑客们真正开始转向使用这个软件前，为什么要嫉妒微软开发了这样一个好用的软件并对此保留版权呢？
\fi

\ifdefined\eng
This was an example of the growing dispute, within the free software community, between those who valued freedom as such, and those who mainly valued powerful, reliable software.  Stallman referred to the two camps as political parties within the community, calling the former the ``freedom party.''  The supporters of the other camp did not try to name it, so Stallman disparagingly called it the ``bandwagon party'' or the ``success party,'' because many of them presented ``more
users'' as the primary goal.
\fi

\ifdefined\chs
.......................
\fi

\ifdefined\eng
In the decade since launching the GNU Project, Stallman had built up a fearsome reputation as a programmer. He had also built up a reputation for intransigence both in terms of software design and people management. This was partly true, but the reputation provided a convenient excuse that anyone could cite if Stallman did not do as he wished.  The reputation has been augmented by mistaken guesses.
\fi

\ifdefined\chs
在GNU工程开始的前十年中，斯托曼已经在程序员中建立起了威信。他也在软件设计和人员管理中建立了一种不妥协声望。................
\fi

\ifdefined\eng
For example, shortly before the 1996 conference, the Free Software Foundation experienced a full-scale staff defection.  Brian Youmans, a current FSF staffer hired by Salus in the wake of the resignations, recalls the scene: ``At one point, Peter [Salus] was the only staff member working in the office.''  The previous staff were unhappy with the executive director; as Bryt Bradley told her friends in December, 1995:
\fi

\ifdefined\chs
在1996年大会开始前不久，自由软件基金会遭遇了一次大面积的离职事件，事件的起因很大程度是因为斯托曼。Brain Youmans，Salus招聘的现任的FSF职员回忆到：“在那时候，Peter [Salus]是留在办公室中的唯一职员”。.........................
\fi

\ifdefined\eng
\begin{quote}
[name omitted] (the Executive Director of the FSF) decided to come back from Medical/Political Leave last week. The office staff (Gena Bean, Mike Drain, and myself) decided we could not work with her as our supervisor because of the many mistakes she had made in her job tasks prior to her taking a leave.  Also, there had been numerous instances where individuals were threatened with inappropriate firing and there  were many instances of what we felt were verbal abuse from her to ALL members of the office staff.  We requested (many times) that she not come back as our supervisor, but stated that we were willing to work with her as a co-worker.  Our requests were ignored.  We quit.
\end{quote}
\fi

\ifdefined\chs
................
\fi

\ifdefined\eng
The executive director in question then gave Stallman an ultimatum: give her total autonomy in the office or she would quit.  Stallman, as president of the FSF, declined to give her total control over its activities, so she resigned, and he recruited in Peter Salus to replace her.
\fi

\ifdefined\chs
........................
\fi

\ifdefined\eng
When Raymond, an outsider, learned that these people had left the FSF, he presumed Stallman was at fault.  This provided confirmation for his theory that Stallman's personality was the cause of any and all problems in the GNU Project.
\fi

\ifdefined\chs
.......................
\fi

\ifdefined\eng
Raymond had another theory: recent delays such as the Hurd and recent troubles such as the Lucid-Emacs schism reflected problems normally associated with software project management, not software code development.
\fi

\ifdefined\chs
................
\fi

\ifdefined\eng
Shortly after the Freely Redistributable Software Conference, Raymond began working on his own pet software project, a mail utility called ``fetchmail.'' Taking a cue from Torvalds, Raymond issued his program with a tacked-on promise to update the source code as early and as often as possible. When users began sending in bug reports and feature suggestions, Raymond, at first anticipating a tangled mess, found the resulting software surprisingly sturdy. Analyzing the success of the Torvalds approach, Raymond issued a quick analysis: using the Internet as his ``petri dish'' and the harsh scrutiny of the hacker community as a form of natural selection, Torvalds had created an evolutionary model free of central planning.
\fi

\ifdefined\chs
....................
\fi

\ifdefined\eng
What's more, Raymond decided, Torvalds had found a way around Brooks' Law. First articulated by Fred P. Brooks, manager of IBM's OS/360 project and author of the 1975 book, \textit{The Mythical Man-Month}, Brooks' Law held that adding developers to a project only resulted in further project delays. Believing as most hackers that software, like soup, benefits from a limited number of cooks, Raymond sensed something revolutionary at work. In inviting more and more cooks into the kitchen, Torvalds had actually found a way to make the resulting software \textit{better}.\endnote{Brooks' Law is the shorthand summary of the following quote taken from Brooks' book:
\begin{quote}
Since software construction is inherently a systems effort -- an exercise in complex interrelationships -- communication effort is great, and it quickly dominates the decrease in individual task time brought about by partitioning. Adding more men then lengthens, not shortens, the schedule.
\end{quote}
\noindent See Fred P. Brooks, \textit{The Mythical Man-Month} (Addison Wesley Publishing, 1995).
}
\fi

\ifdefined\chs
另一方面，雷蒙德觉得，托瓦兹找到了一种突破Brooks法则的方式。在IBM OS/360项目经理Fred P. Brooks于1975年出版的《\textit{人月神话}》一书中，Brooks提出了Brooks法则：向一个软件项目中增加开发者的作法只会造成项目的进一步延迟。对于黑客们来说，写软件就像做汤，增加厨师的人数对于改善汤的口味并没有太多作用。雷蒙德从中感觉到了一些革命性的变化：托瓦兹确实在聘请更多的厨师进入厨房的同时，做出了\textit{更好}的软件。\endnote{Brooks法则是对他的书中如下的描述的简称：
\begin{quote}
由于设计软件本质上是一个系统性的工作，沟通的成本很高，把任务分割成多个子任务会使沟通成本的大大增加。所以，向软件项目中增加人手只会增加软件开发时间，而不是缩短。
\end{quote}
\noindent 参考 Fred P. Brooks, 《\textit{人月神话}》 (Addison Wesley Publishing, 1995)

\ifdefined\eng
Raymond put his observations on paper. He crafted them into a speech, which he promptly delivered before a group of friends and neighbors in Chester County, Pennsylvania. Dubbed ``The Cathedral and the Bazaar,'' the speech contrasted the ``Bazaar'' style originated by Torvalds with the ``Cathedral'' style generally used by everyone else.
\fi

\ifdefined\chs
雷蒙德把他的发现写成了论文，并把它变成若干次演讲，在宾夕法尼亚州Chester County的一些朋友和邻居们面前宣传。在一个名为《教堂与集市》的演讲中，他比较了GNU工程与托瓦兹和内核黑客位使用的管理风格进行了比较。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。
\fi

\ifdefined\eng
Raymond says the response was enthusiastic, but not nearly as enthusiastic as the one he received during the 1997 Linux Kongress, a gathering of GNU/Linux users in Germany the next spring.
\fi

\ifdefined\chs
雷蒙德说这些演讲的反响很热烈，不过都不如次年春天他在德国召开的1997 Linux Kongress上的那次演讲。
\fi

\ifdefined\eng
``At the Kongress, they gave me a standing ovation at the end of the speech,'' Raymond recalls. ``I took that as significant for two reasons. For one thing, it meant they were excited by what they were hearing. For another thing, it meant they were excited even after hearing the speech delivered through a language barrier.''
\fi

\ifdefined\chs
”在Kongress上，演讲结束后听众都起身鼓掌“，雷蒙德回忆道。”我把这次成功归纳成两个因素。首先，这说明听众们为所听到的内容感到激动。其次，这意味着即使存在一些语言交流上的障碍，听众们依然感到兴奋。“
\fi

\ifdefined\eng
Eventually, Raymond would convert the speech into a paper, also titled ``The Cathedral and the Bazaar.'' The paper drew its name from Raymond's central analogy. Previously, programs were ``cathedrals,'' impressive, centrally planned monuments built to stand the test of time. Linux, on the other hand, was more like ``a great babbling bazaar,'' a software program developed through the loose decentralizing dynamics of the Internet.
\fi

\ifdefined\chs
最后，雷蒙德把这些演讲的内容写成了论文，同样起名为《教堂与集市》。这篇论文的题目来自雷蒙德的核心思想。GNU程序就是“教堂”，它们都是有计划的修建的宏伟的黑客精神的纪念碑，经得起时间的考验。而另一方面，Linux则更像是一个嘈杂的大集市，它是在Internet去中心化的松散组织结构中开发出来的。
\fi

\ifdefined\eng
Raymond's paper associated the Cathedral style, which he and Stallman and many others had used, specifically with the GNU Project and Stallman, thus casting the contrast between development models as a comparison between Stallman and Torvalds. Where Stallman was his chosen example of the classic cathedral architect -- i.e., a programming ``wizard'' who could disappear for 18 months and return with something like the GNU C Compiler -- Torvalds was more like a genial dinner-party host. In letting others lead the Linux design discussion and stepping in only when the entire table needed a referee, Torvalds had created a development model very much reflective of his own laid-back personality. From Torvalds' perspective, the most important managerial task was not imposing control but keeping the ideas flowing.
\fi

\ifdefined\chs
相似的类比同样也适用于斯托曼和托瓦兹。斯托曼代表着经典的教堂架构，他像一个程序魔法师一样，在消失了18月以后，带来了类似于GNU C编译器这样的神作。而托瓦兹则像是一个亲切的宴会主人。他让别人来领导Linux的设计讨论，并只在关键时候提出一些参考建议。托瓦兹所创建的这种开发模式正好反映了的懒散的个性。从托瓦兹的观点来看，最好的管理工作不是要加强对事情的控制，而是要保持思维的活跃度。
\fi

\ifdefined\eng
Summarized Raymond, ``I think Linus's cleverest and most consequential hack was not the construction of the Linux kernel itself, but rather his invention of the Linux development model.''\endnote{See Eric Raymond, ``The Cathedral and the Bazaar'' (1997).}
\fi

\ifdefined\chs
雷蒙德总结说：，“我觉得Linux最聪明的地方和最重要的hack就是创造出来Linux内核，而不是他所创造的Linux开发模式。”\endnote{参考埃里克·雷蒙德的文章“教堂与集市”，1997年。}
\fi

\ifdefined\eng
If the paper's description of these two styles of development was perceptive, its association of the Cathedral model specifically with Stallman (rather than all the others who had used it, including Raymond himself) was sheer calumny.  In fact, the developers of some GNU packages including the GNU Hurd had read about and adopted Torvalds' methods before Raymond tried them, though without analyzing them further and publicly championing them as Raymond's paper did. Thousands of hackers, reading Raymond's article, must have been led to a negative attitude towards GNU by this smear.
\fi

\ifdefined\chs

\fi

\ifdefined\eng
In summarizing the secrets of Torvalds' managerial success, Raymond attracted the attention of other members of the free software community for whom freedom was not a priority.  They sought to interest business in the use and development of free software, and to do so, decided to cast the issue in terms of the values that appeal to business: powerful, reliable, cheap, advanced.  Raymond became the best-known proponent of these ideas, and they reached the management of Netscape, whose proprietary browser was losing market share to Microsoft's equally proprietary Internet Explorer.  Intrigued by a speech by Raymond, Netscape executives took the message back to corporate headquarters. A few months later, in January, 1998, the company announced its plan to publish the source code of its flagship Navigator web browser in the hopes of enlisting hacker support in future development.
\fi

\ifdefined\chs
在总结托瓦兹的成功管理经验方面，雷蒙德做自己也完成得的非常出色。.................跟预期的情况一样，听众并不仅仅被黑客所震惊，也有很多人对自由软件运动的快速成长表达了强烈的兴趣。Netscap就是其中的一个，。这家成立于加州山景城的创业公司，刚刚经历一了一场场持续了三年的与微软争夺Web浏览器的市场的争夺。出于对雷蒙德演讲的好奇和希望赢回失去的市场份额的期望目的，Netscape的执行官们居们把这次演讲的信息带回了公司总部。几个月以后，1998年1月，Netscape宣布计划把它的旗舰级产品Navigator Web浏览器的代码公开，希望能得到黑客们的支持，完成以后的开发。...............
\fi

\ifdefined\eng
When Netscape CEO Jim Barksdale cited Raymond's ``Cathedral and the Bazaar'' essay as a major influence upon the company's decision, the company instantly elevated Raymond to the level of hacker celebrity. He invited a few people including Larry Augustin, founder of VA Research which sold workstations with the GNU/Linux operating system preinstalled; Tim O'Reilly,  founder of the publisher O'Reilly \& Associates; and Christine Peterson, president of the Foresight Institute, a Silicon Valley think tank specializing in nanotechnology, to talk. ``The meeting's agenda boiled down to one item: how to take advantage of Netscape's decision so that other companies might follow suit?''
\fi

\ifdefined\chs
Netscape CEO Jim Barksdale说雷蒙德的“教堂与集市”文章对于公司做出这样的决策有着深远的影响，公司很快把雷蒙德地位抬升到了黑客界的知名人士。为了紧紧抓住这次机会，雷蒙德出差去西海岸去进行采访，向Netscape的执行官们提供建议，并且参与了Netscape Navigator源代码开放庆祝的聚会。Navigator的源代码的code name是“Mozilla”，这个名字一方面象征着这个程序的源代码有30万行的代码，同时也象征着它的血统。作为一个Mosaic浏览器的非商业化版本，Marc Adressen在Illionis大学开发这个浏览器时也参考了Mosaic的设计，这就再次证明了大部分程序员在打算开发一个新的程序时，总是会借鉴一些现有的、可以修改的程序。..................Tim O'Reilly当时也在Linux Kongress的会场聆听演讲，他是O'Reilly \& Associcates出版公司的创始人，这家公司专注于出版软件使用手册和软件相关的书籍（同样也是本书的出版商）。听完了雷蒙德在Kongress上的演讲后，O'Reilly迅速地邀请雷蒙德参加下半年在加州Monterey举办的首届Perl大会，在会议上再次分享这个主题。............
\fi

\ifdefined\eng
Raymond doesn't recall the conversation that took place, but he does remember the first complaint addressed. Despite the best efforts of Stallman and other hackers to remind people that the word ``free'' in free software stood for freedom and not price, the message still wasn't getting through. Most business executives, upon hearing the term for the first time, interpreted the word as synonymous with ``zero cost,'' tuning out any follow-up messages in short order. Until hackers found a way to get past this misunderstanding, the free software movement faced an uphill climb, even after Netscape.
\fi

\ifdefined\chs
雷蒙德不记得这次讨论的内容，但是他记得这次会议中的提到的另一个问题。不管斯托曼和其他黑客如何努力的去提醒人们自由软件中的“Free”一词是指“自由”而不是“免费”，但这一点仍然没有得到大众的真正认知。第一次听到这个名词时，许多商业管理者都把它当作是“零成本”的同义词，而并不注意它蕴含着的其它相关信息。除非黑客们能找到一种方法解决这个认识上的偏差，否则自由软件运动就会面临一个高耸难攀的山峰，即使有Netscape的案例供参考，也很难一举登顶。

Peterson, whose organization had taken an active interest in advancing the free software cause, offered an alternative: ``open source.''

Looking back, Peterson says she came up with the ``open source'' term while discussing Netscape's decision with a friend in the public relations industry. She doesn't remember where she came upon the term or if she borrowed it from another field, but she does remember her friend disliking the term.\endnote{See Malcolm Maclachlan, ``Profit Motive Splits Open Source Movement,'' \textit{TechWeb News} (August 26, 1998), \url{http://www.techweb.com/article/showArticle?articleID=29102344}.}

彼德森回忆道，她是在与一个朋友讨论Netscape的决定的时候，想到了“开源”这个词语。她不记得是她自己首创了这个词语，还是从别的什么领域借用了这个词语，但是她确实记得她的朋友并不喜欢这个词语。\endnote{参考Malcolm Maclachlan, ``Profit Motive Splits Open Source Movement,'' \textit{TechWeb News} (August 26, 1998), \url{http://www.techweb.com/article/showArticle?articleID=29102344}.}

\ifdefined\eng
At the meeting, Peterson says, the response was dramatically different. ``I was hesitant about suggesting it,'' Peterson recalls. ``I had no standing with the group, so started using it casually, not highlighting it as a new term.'' To Peterson's surprise, the term caught on. By the end of the meeting, most of the attendees, including Raymond, seemed pleased by it.
\fi

\ifdefined\chs
彼德森说，但是在这次会议上，这个词语得到的反馈却是截然不同的。彼德森回忆说：“我很犹豫要不要提出这个建议，我对这个组织并不了解，所以我在不经意中去使用这个词语，而不是把它作为一个新词语去强调。”然而，这个词语出乎意料的受到了人们的关注。在这次会议结束时，大部分的与会者，包括雷蒙德，对于这个词语都非常满意。

Raymond says he didn't publicly use the term ``open source'' as a substitute for ``free software'' until a day or two after the Mozilla launch party, when O'Reilly had scheduled a meeting to talk about free software. Calling his meeting ``the Freeware Summit,'' O'Reilly says he wanted to direct media and community attention to the other deserving projects that had also encouraged Netscape to release Mozilla. ``All these guys had so much in common, and I was surprised they didn't all know each other,'' says O'Reilly. ``I also wanted to let the world know just how great an impact the free software culture had already made. People were missing out on a large part of the free software tradition.''

雷蒙德说，在Mozilla发布会前几天O'Reilly组织的一次讨论自由软件的会议之前，他从来不公开使用“开源”这个词语来替代“自由软件”。O'Reilly把这次会议叫作“免费软件峰会”，期望把媒体和社区的注意力吸引到其它一些对于Netscape发布Mozilla具有有价值的项目上去。“这些家伙有如此多的相似之处，但我很惊讶他们互相之间谁都不了解谁。”O'Reilly说，“我同时也想让世界知道自由软件文化已经产生了如此深远的影响。人们如果再不对自由软件引起重视，就是错过了一次很好的机会。”

In putting together the invite list, however, O'Reilly made a decision that would have long-term political consequences. He decided to limit the list to west-coast developers such as Wall, Eric Allman, creator of sendmail, and Paul Vixie, creator of BIND. There were exceptions, of course: Pennsylvania-resident Raymond, who was already in town thanks to the Mozilla launch, earned an quick invite. So did Virginia-resident Guido van Rossum, creator of Python. ``Frank Willison, my editor in chief and champion of Python within the company, invited him without first checking in with me,'' O'Reilly recalls. ``I was happy to have him there, but when I started, it really was just a local gathering.''

邀请这些人聚集在一起，是O'Reilly一个深思熟虑的决定，并将产生深远的政治影响。他只打算邀请西海岸的开发者们，比如sendmail的作者Wall, Eric allman，BIND的作者Pal Vixie。不过也有一个人是例外，那就是长居在宾夕法尼亚的雷蒙德，因为他正好来参加Mozilla的发布会，所以也马上邀了他。同样还有弗吉尼亚的Guido van Rossum，他是Python语言的作者。“Frank Willison是我的主编，他是Python的斗士，他决定邀请Guido参加，甚至都没有跟我商量。”，O'Reilly回忆说，“我非常高兴能请到他出席，不过刚开始的时候，我确实只是想组织一个本地聚会。”

For some observers, the unwillingness to include Stallman's name on the list qualified as a snub. ``I decided not to go to the event because of it,'' says Perens, remembering the summit. Raymond, who did go, says he argued for Stallman's inclusion to no avail. The snub rumor gained additional strength from the fact that O'Reilly, the event's host, had feuded publicly with Stallman over the issue of software-manual copyrights. Prior to the meeting, Stallman had argued that free software manuals should be as freely copyable and modifiable as free software programs. O'Reilly, meanwhile, argued that a value-added market for nonfree books increased the utility of free software by making it more accessible to a wider community. The two had also disputed the title of the event, with Stallman insisting on ``Free Software'' rather than ``Freeware.''  The latter term most often refers to programs which are available gratis, but which are not free software because their source code is not released.

对于一些观察者来说，没有邀请斯托曼参加这次会议可以算是有点怠慢。“正是由于这个原因，我决定不去参加这次会议。” 佩伦斯回忆这次峰会时回忆道。雷蒙德参加了这次会议，并认为即使邀请斯托曼也是徒劳的。有关这次会议的组织者O'Reilly怠慢斯托曼的传言，在O'Reilly与斯托曼公开表明在软件手册的权限问题上的不同意见后，变得更能让人信服。在会议前，斯托曼曾表示，自由软件手册应该可以像自由软件本身一样自由的复制和修改。而O'Reilly那时认为非自由的图书是对自由软件的增值，它们能让自由软件被更多的社区所熟悉。O'Reilly和斯托曼还为这次会议的名称争论，斯托曼坚持要使用“自由软件”来代替不那么政治化的“免费软件”一词。

Looking back, O'Reilly doesn't see the decision to leave Stallman's name off the invite list as a snub. ``At that time, I had never met Richard in person, but in our email interactions, he'd been inflexible and unwilling to engage in dialogue. I wanted to make sure the GNU tradition was represented at the meeting, so I invited John Gilmore and Michael Tiemann, whom I knew personally, and whom I knew were passionate about the value of the GPL but seemed more willing to engage in a frank back-and-forth about the strengths and weaknesses of the various free software projects and traditions. Given all the later brouhaha, I do wish I'd invited Richard as well, but I certainly don't think that my failure to do so should be interpreted as a lack of respect for the GNU Project or for Richard personally.''
\fi

回头去看，O'Reilly仍然认为不邀请斯托曼的决定是怠慢了他。O’Reilly说：“在那个时候，我没有见过理查德·斯托曼本人，不过在我们的电子邮件沟通中，斯托曼看上去是个很强势的人，并且不太愿意加入对话。我希望能够保证在会议中展示出GNU的传统，所以我邀请了约翰·吉尔摩和Michael 蒂曼，这两个人我都比较熟悉，我知道他们对于GPL的价值都非常有热情，不过看上去他们更愿意参与有关自由软件项目和传统的优势和弱点的讨论。从后面发生的事情来看，我有点后悔没有邀请理查德，但是我没有这么做并不能看成是对GNU工程或理查德.斯托曼本人的不敬。”

Snub or no snub, both O'Reilly and Raymond say the term ``open source'' won over just enough summit-goers to qualify as a success. The attendees shared ideas and experiences and brainstormed on how to improve free software's image. Of key concern was how to point out the successes of free software, particularly in the realm of Internet infrastructure, as opposed to playing up the GNU/Linux challenge to Microsoft Windows. But like the earlier meeting at VA, the discussion soon turned to the problems associated with the term ``free software.'' O'Reilly, the summit host, remembers a comment from Torvalds, a summit attendee.

无论是不是怠慢了斯托曼，O'Reilly和雷蒙德说的“开源”一词成功的赢得了很多与会者的支持。与会者分享了各种想法和经验，并且一起进行了一场头脑风暴，讨论如何提升自由软件的形象。讨论的焦点是如何才能展示自由软件的成功之处，尤其是在实现Internet的基础架构方面，而不是讨论GNU/Linux是如何与微软Windows进行竞争的问题。不过跟很多早期在VA召开的会议一样，这些讨论的内容在不经意间就转向了讨论“自由软件”这个词自身所存在的问题。作为会议的主办者，O'Reilly记得峰会的与会者托瓦兹的一段很有见地评论。

Although the term appealed to some, support for a change in official terminology was far from unanimous. At the end of the one-day conference, attendees put the three terms -- free software, open source, or sourceware -- to a vote. According to O'Reilly, 9 out of the 15 attendees voted for ``open source.'' Although some still quibbled with the term, all attendees agreed to use it in future discussions with the press. ``We wanted to go out with a solidarity message,'' O'Reilly says.

虽然“开源”这个词对一些人很有吸引力，但是要让它取代“自由软件”变为一个官方的用词还有很长的路要走。结束一天的会议前，与会者开始对三个词语进行投票，“自由软件”、“开源”和“sourceware”。O'Reilly说，15名与会者中有9人把票投给了“开源”。虽然有一部分人对这个词还有些意见，不过所有的与会者都同意在以后与媒体的讨论中可以使用这个词汇。O'Reilly说，”我们希望发出一些团结的信号“。

The term didn't take long to enter the national lexicon. Shortly after the summit, O'Reilly shepherded summit attendees to a press conference attended by reporters from the \textit{New York Times}, the \textit{Wall Street Journal}, and other prominent publications. Within a few months, Torvalds' face was appearing on the cover of \textit{Forbes} magazine, with the faces of Stallman, Perl creator Larry Wall, and Apache team leader Brian Behlendorf featured in the interior spread. Open source was open for business.

``There's no question that the use of the word free was confusing in a lot of situations,'' Tiemann says. ``Open source positioned itself as being business friendly and business sensible. Free software positioned itself as morally righteous. For better or worse we figured it was more advantageous to align with the open source crowd.''

Raymond called Stallman after the meeting to tell him about the new term ``open source'' and ask if he would use it.  Raymond says Stallman briefly considered adopting the term, only to discard it. ``I know because I had direct personal conversations about it,'' Raymond says.

Stallman's immediate response was, ``I'll have to think about it.''  The following day he had concluded that the values of Raymond and O'Reilly would surely dominate the future discourse of ``open source,'' and that the best way to keep the ideas of the free software movement in public view was to stick to its traditional term.

Later in 1998, Stallman announced his position: ``open source,'' while helpful in communicating the technical advantages of free software also encouraged speakers to soft-pedal the issue of software freedom. It avoided the unintended meaning of ``gratis software'' and the intended meaning of ``freedom-respecting software'' equally.  As a means for conveying the latter meaning, it was therefore no use.  In effect, Raymond and O'Reilly had given a name to the nonidealistic political party in the community, the one Stallman did not agree with.

In addition, Stallman thought that the ideas of ``open source'' led people to put too much emphasis on winning the support of business.  While such support in itself wasn't necessarily bad in itself, he expected that being too desperate for it would lead to harmful compromises.  ``Negotiation 101 would teach you that if you are desperate to get someone's agreement, you are asking for a bad deal,'' he says.  ``You need to be prepared to say no.''  Summing up his position at the 1999 LinuxWorld Convention and Expo, an event billed by Torvalds himself as a ``coming out party'' for the ``Linux'' community, Stallman implored his fellow hackers to resist the lure of easy compromise.

``Because we've shown how much we can do, we don't have to be desperate to work with companies or compromise our goals,'' Stallman said during a panel discussion. ``Let them offer and we'll accept. We don't have to change what we're doing to get them to help us. You can take a single step towards a goal, then another and then more and more and you'll actually reach your goal. Or, you can take a half measure that means you don't ever take another step, and you'll never get there.''

斯托曼在一次小组讨论上说：“我们已经展示了很多我们已经取得的成就，所以我们不需要去讨好公司而放弃我们的目标。如果公司能向我们提供帮助，我们可以接受。如果公司不愿意，我们也没有必要去改变自己来争取这些帮助。只要你能不断向着目标慢慢前进，最终一定能实现目标。如果你们什么事情都采用折中的方式，不真正往前前进，就永远也不能实现目标。”

Even before the LinuxWorld show, however, Stallman was showing an increased willingness to alienate open source supporters. A few months after the Freeware Summit, O'Reilly hosted its second annual Perl Conference. This time around, Stallman was in attendance. During a panel discussion lauding IBM's decision to employ the free software Apache web server in its commercial offerings, Stallman, taking advantage of an audience microphone, made a sharp denunciation of panelist John Ousterhout, creator of the Tcl scripting language. Stallman branded Ousterhout a ``parasite'' on the free software community for marketing a proprietary version of Tcl via Ousterhout's startup company, Scriptics.  Ousterhout had stated that Scriptics would contribute only the barest minimum of its improvements to the free version of Tcl, meaning it would in effect use that small contribution to win community approval for much a larger amount of nonfree software development.  Stallman rejected this position and denounced Scriptics' plans. ``I don't think Scriptics is necessary for the continued existence of Tcl,'' Stallman said to hisses from the fellow audience members.\endnote{\textit{Ibid.}}
\fi

事实上，在LinuWorld之前，斯托曼已经表现出他正在慢慢疏远他的同盟。Freeware峰会后几个月，O'Reilly的主办了他的第二次年度Perl大会。这一次，斯托曼参加了会议。在一次称赞IBM决定在他的商用方案中整合Apache Web服务器这个自由软件的小组讨论中，斯托曼抢过了听众的话筒，把矛头指向了讨论人John Ousterhout，他是Tcl脚本语言的作者。斯托曼把Ousterhout称为是自由软件社区的寄生虫，因为他通过他自己的名为Scriptics的创业公司稍售一个商业版本的Tcl。“我不觉得Scriptics是Tcl继续存活下去所必须的。”斯托曼在听众们的窃窃私语中坚定地表明道。

``It was a pretty ugly scene,'' recalls Prime Time Freeware's Rich Morin. ``John's done some pretty respectable things: Tcl, Tk, Sprite. He's a real contributor.''  Despite his sympathies for Stallman and Stallman's position, Morin felt empathy for those troubled by Stallman's discordant words.

“这是一种很尴尬的场面。” Prime TIme Freeware的李奇·莫林回忆说，“John做出了一些很让人值得尊敬的东西——Tcl，Tk和Sprite。他是一个真正的贡献者”。莫林很理解斯托曼以及他的立场，但他也同样也理解那些被斯托曼“无理”的行为扫了兴的人们。

Stallman will not apologize.  ``Criticizing proprietary software isn't ugly -- proprietary software is ugly.  Ousterhout had indeed made real contributions in the past, but the point is that Scriptics was going to be nearly 100\% a proprietary software company.  In that conference, standing up for freedom meant disagreeing with nearly everyone. Speaking from the audience, I could only say a few sentences.  The only way to raise the issue so it would not be immediately forgotten was to put it in strong terms.''

Stallman's controversial criticism of Ousterhout momentarily alienated a potential sympathizer, Bruce Perens. In 1998, Eric Raymond proposed launching the Open Source Initiative, or OSI, an organization that would police the use of the term ``open source'' and provide a definition for companies interested in making their own programs. Raymond recruited Perens to draft the definition.\endnote{See Bruce Perens et al., ``The Open Source Definition,'' The Open Source Initiative (1998), \url{http://www.opensource.org/docs/definition.html}.}

Perens would later resign from the OSI, expressing regret that the organization had set itself up in opposition to Stallman and the FSF. Still, looking back on the need for a free software definition outside the Free Software Foundation's auspices, Perens understands why other hackers might still feel the need for distance. ``I really like and admire Richard,'' says Perens. ``I do think Richard would do his job better if Richard had more balance. That includes going away from free software for a couple of months.''

佩伦斯不久就从OSI的高管位子上辞职，他对这个组织与斯托曼和FSF对立的立场表示遗憾。同样的，回头去看，在FSF以外重新定义自由软件的需求，佩伦斯理解了为什么其它的黑客们仍然觉得需要与之保持距离。“我非常敬仰理查德”,佩伦斯说，“我觉得如果他能更为平衡的处理各方关系的话，他会把事情完成得更好。这包括花几个月时间远离自由软件。”

Stallman's energies would do little to counteract the public-relations momentum of open source proponents. In August of 1998, when chip-maker Intel purchased a stake in GNU/Linux vendor Red Hat, an accompanying \textit{New York Times} article described the company as the product of a movement ``known alternatively as free software and open source.''\endnote{See Amy Harmon, ``For Sale: Free Operating System,'' \textit{New York Times} (September 28, 1998), \url{http://www.nytimes.com/library/tech/98/09/biztech/articles/28linux.html}.} Six months later, a John Markoff article on Apple Computer was proclaiming the company's adoption of the ``open source'' Apache server in the article headline.\endnote{See John Markoff, ``Apple Adopts `Open Source' for its Server Computers,'' \textit{New York Times} (March 17, 1999), \url{http://www.nytimes.com/library/tech/99/03/biztech/articles/17apple.html}.}

斯托曼的偏执不太会抵消与开源斗士动力之间的公共关系。1998年8月，芯片厂商Intel购买了GNU/Linux供应商Red Hat的股份，纽约时报在随后的文章中评价Red Hat为“自由软件和开源”运动的产物。\endnote{............} 半年后，John Markoff在Apple Computer杂志上发表文章，标题中称该公司使用“开源”的Apache服务器。\endnote{........}................

Such momentum would coincide with the growing momentum of companies that actively embraced the ``open source'' term. By August of 1999, Red Hat, a company that now eagerly billed itself as ``open source,'' was selling shares on Nasdaq. In December, VA Linux -- formerly VA Research -- was floating its own IPO to historic effect. Opening at \$30 per share, the company's stock price exploded past the \$300 mark in initial trading only to settle back down to the \$239 level. Shareholders lucky enough to get in at the bottom and stay until the end experienced a 698\% increase in paper wealth, a Nasdaq record.  Eric Raymond, as a board member, owned shares worth \$36 million.  However, these high prices were temporary; they tumbled when the dot-com boom ended.

这样的势头与很多公司拥抱“开源”一词的动力非常一致。到了1999年8月，Red Hat这家乐意把自己标榜为“开源”的公司在纳斯达克上市。同年12月，VA Linux公司（曾经的VA Research）正式IPO。这家公司的股票从开盘的30美元一股一路彪升到300美元，并最后回稳在239美元左右。股东们很幸运的抄了底,并且享受到了698\%的纸面收益，打破了斯达克的历史记录。....................

The open source proponents' message was simple: all you need, to sell the free software concept, is to make it business-friendly.

These methods won great success for open source, but not for the ideals of free software.  What they had done to ``spread the message'' was to omit the most important part of it: the idea of freedom as an ethical issue.  The effects of this omission are visible today: as of 2009, nearly all GNU/Linux distributions include proprietary programs, Torvalds' version of Linux contains proprietary firmware programs, and the company formerly called VA Linux bases its business on proprietary software.  Over half of all the world's web servers run some version of Apache, and the usual version of Apache is free software, but many of those sites run a proprietary modified version distributed by IBM.

不管这些评论是否减轻了雷蒙德和其它开源拥护者是为金钱为目的嫌疑，但是他们向开源社区传达了一个最基本的信息：想要宣传自由软件的概念，只需要一张友善的面孔和合乎情理的信号。不用像斯托曼那样正面与商业市场斗争，雷蒙德、托瓦兹和其它黑客社区的新领导者们需要一种更宽松的方式：在某些领域忽略市场，通过别的方式去影响它。不能扮演被学校开除的那个角色，而应该成为社会的名流、在这个过程中不断扩大自己的影响力。

``On his worst days Richard believes that Linus Torvalds and I conspired to hijack his revolution,'' Raymond says. ``Richard's rejection of the term open source and his deliberate creation of an ideological fissure in my view comes from an odd mix of idealism and territoriality. There are people out there who think it's all Richard's personal ego. I don't believe that. It's more that he so personally associates himself with the free software idea that he sees any threat to that as a threat to himself.''

雷蒙德说：“在理查德最不如意的日子里，他认为我和Linus托瓦兹搞阴谋绑架他的革命。理查德拒绝开源一词的使用和他故意对我的观点做出的意识形态上的分裂是由于他自己对理想主义和地域性奇怪混合的结果。从外人的眼光看来，可能会以为这是理查德的个人野心膨胀的结果。我不这样认为。我觉得这不仅仅是野心，这更是因为理查德把自己和自由软件的理念紧紧的绑在了一起，在他看来，任何对自由软件的威胁就是对他本人的威胁。”

Stallman responds, ``Raymond misrepresents my views: I don't think Torvalds `conspired' with anyone, since being sneaky is not his way. However, Raymond's nasty conduct is visible in those statements themselves.   Rather than respond to my views (even as he claims they are) on their merits, he proposes psychological interpretations for them. He attributes the harshest interpretation to unnamed others, then `defends' me by proposing a slightly less derogatory one.  He has often `defended' me this way.''

Ironically, the success of open source and open source advocates such as Raymond would not diminish Stallman's role as a leader -- but it would lead many to misunderstand what he is a leader of.  Since the free software movement lacks the corporate and media recognition of open source, most users of GNU/Linux do not hear that it exists, let alone what its views are.  They have heard the ideas and values of open source, and they never imagine that Stallman might have different ones.  Thus he receives messages thanking him for his advocacy of ``open source,'' and explains in response that he has never been a supporter of that, using the occasion to inform the sender about free software.

让人觉得讽刺的是，开源和像雷蒙德这样的开源拥护者的胜利并不能撼动斯托曼作为领导者的角色。斯托曼的一举一动都有机会给他带来新的追随者。而雷蒙德的领地的主管则没有这样的能力。斯托曼时常手握武器，不是因为出于原则，而更多是出于习惯：比如，他一开始反对Linux内核，现在则不愿意成为一个为了软件问题理想冒险的政治形象。”...............................

Some writers recognize the term ``free software'' by using the term ``FLOSS,'' which stands for ``Free/Libre and Open Source Software.''  However, they often say there is a single ``FLOSS'' movement, which is like saying that the U.S. has a ``Liberal/Conservative'' movement, and the views they usually associate with this supposed single movement are the open source views they have heard.

Despite all these obstacles, the free software movement does make its ideas heard sometimes, and continues to grow in absolute terms.  By sticking to its guns, and presenting its ideas in contrast to those of open source, it gains ground. ``One of Stallman's primary character traits is the fact he doesn't budge,'' says Ian Murdock. ``He'll wait up to a decade for people to come around to his point of view if that's what it takes.''

除此之外，近期关于开源的争论也表明：当斯托曼手握武器时，通常是他找到了一种可以让他的事业有所进展的方式的时候。伊恩·默多克说：”斯托曼最重的一个性格特征就是他不会动摇自己的立场。如果需要，为了让别人接受他的观点，他可以等上十年。”
\fi

Murdock, for one, finds that unbudgeable nature both refreshing and valuable. Stallman may no longer be the solitary leader of the free software movement, but he is still the polestar of the free software community. ``You always know that he's going to be consistent in his views,'' Murdock says. ``Most people aren't like that. Whether you agree with him or not, you really have to respect that.''
\fi

\ifdefined\chs
默多克所发现的斯托曼这个不动摇的特质既新鲜又宝贵。就算斯托曼不再是自由软件运动的唯一领袖，他仍然是自由软件社区的北极星。默多克说：“你可以确定他永远会坚持他自己的观点。大部分人都不是这样的。不管你是否同意他的观点，你都必须尊重他的观点。” 因为事实常常证明：他站得更高，看得更远。
